Interactive protein-protein network visualization based on vis.js

Based on discussions with colleagues Phil Snyder (Vertex) and Venky Soundararajan (neference), I decided to put together a protein-protein interaction network visualization. 

The idea was to see if we could find any second-order effects of a small molecular therapeutic. Such molecules might target one or more proteins, and inhibiting or activating one protein might be a way to cure a disease. But what other proteins does the small molecule interact with? Moreover, what proteins do the original target, and any unintended targets interact with? Can we predict such 2nd order effects in a precise, even personalized way to improve clinical trials, reduce potential for toxicity, or design improved therapeutics?
